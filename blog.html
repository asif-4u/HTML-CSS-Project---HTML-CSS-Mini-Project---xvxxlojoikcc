                    <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2022</h2>
                    <p>The journey of Centurion University of Technology and Management
                       (CUTM) began in the year 2005 by a group of ambitious academics 
                       with aspirations to provide high quality education both nationally 
                       and internationally. The first step in this direction was to take 
                       over an ailing engineering Institute, the Jagannath Institute for 
                       Technology and Management (JITM) in one of the most challenging tribal 
                       districts of Odisha and one which was considered to be a left-wing extremist 
                       affected area. Subsequently, JITM was transformed into Centurion University 
                       of Technology and Management in August 2010, through an act of Odisha Legislative 
                       Assembly. It became the First Multi-Sector State Private University in Odisha.</p>
                       <br>
                    <p>Our founders during their earlier stint as teachers realized that education is 
                       one of the most powerful tool for empowerment, was in reality designed for the 
                       elite. In response, they embarked on this ambitious journey with the aim to bring 
                       employment-linked education within the reach of those who needed it the most. As a 
                       result, Centurion University has skilled, trained and linked 80,000+ “poor, more 
                       poor and ultra poor” youth to find gainful employment. Through five Social Enterprises 
                       established under the University, Teaching, Training, Production and Community engagement 
                       is converged into mainstream education thus enabling the University to ensure hands-on 
                       knowledge, experiential learning and practice-linked pedagogy with the flexibility of 
                       horizontal and vertical mobility.</p>
                       <br>
                    <p>Their vision was to build Centurion University brick by brick not only as a home for 
                       research and education but as an institution which provides opportunities for growth to 
                       all students from across the social canvas and they have succeeded in consolidating Centurion 
                       University as a truly remarkable place, with expertise across a wide range of disciplines and 
                       a superb academic atmosphere. As a student in Centurion University, you will be working with 
                       academic staff who are well recognized in their fields of study; academics who are committed 
                       to seeing you succeed and will help you develop your ideas, knowledge and understanding</p>
                    <br>

                       Its unique model lays specific emphasis on creating sustainable livelihoods on a national scale
